# ASHA Pregnancy Tracking System — Offline-First Maternal & Child Healthcare Platform

An independent, production-grade, offline-first digital maternal healthcare tracking platform engineered for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), Medical Officers (MOs), and Block/District Health Supervisors in India.

Reference Standard: **Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) Maternal and Child Protection (MCP) & National Health Mission (NHM) guidelines**.

## 1. Direct Answer: Can We Connect to JANANI & ANMOL?

> **User Question:** *"and that like https://janani.mohfw.gov.in or https://hmfw.ap.gov.in/anmol will the api is avillable cn conect it"*

### Executive Summary & Technical Reality
**Yes, technically and architecturally — but only through formal government authorization and institutional channels.**

Neither `https://janani.mohfw.gov.in` (National RCH/MCTS Maternal Tracking Portal) nor `https://hmfw.ap.gov.in/anmol` (Andhra Pradesh / National ANM Online) expose open, public REST APIs on the open web.

To safeguard Indian citizens' sensitive demographic and medical data, official access requires:
1. **Institutional Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** with the State Health Society (NHM) or MoHFW National Health Portal Division.
2. **National Informatics Centre (NIC) Firewall Whitelisting** for dedicated server IP addresses.
3. **Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) / mSVS Client Certificates** with mutual TLS (mTLS) and token authentication.

### Built-in Solution: `GovernmentPortalAdapter`
This platform includes a dedicated, production-ready **`GovernmentPortalAdapter`** (`backend/app/services/government_portal_adapter.py`):
- **Sandbox Mode (Active Default)**: Accepts beneficiary records, transforms them into official JANANI (`MCTS_Registration` schema) and ANMOL (`anmol_sync_v2` schema) formats, validates all constraints (e.g. LGD village code, gestational limits, BP/Hb thresholds), and generates synthetic NIC acknowledgment tokens (`NIC-JAN-YYYYMM-XXXX`).
- **Live Mode Ready**: When an institutional user mounts approved NIC certificates and sets `GOV_INTEGRATION_MODE=LIVE`, the adapter routes payloads directly over authenticated NIC gateways without altering the core application logic.

## 2. Key Capabilities & Features

1. **Bilingual User Interface**: Complete Tamil (தமிழ்) and English interfaces with instant one-tap language switching.
2. **Offline-First Architecture**:
   - Field workers can register beneficiaries, record ANC/PNC visits, document home visits, and log emergency referrals with **zero internet connection**.
   - Offline records persist in local device storage and are enqueued into a resilient sync queue.
   - Built-in **"Simulate Offline" toggle** right in the application header for testing field scenarios with a single click.
3. **Robust Synchronization Engine**:
   - Idempotent UUID transactions (`client_tx_id`) preventing duplicate visits upon repeated sync attempts.
   - Record version counters (`version_id`) detecting concurrent modifications and reconciling conflicts.
   - Clinical safety rule: Risk factors and danger signs are **never** discarded or overwritten silently.
4. **Deterministic Clinical Rules (No Auto-Diagnosis / No Auto-Downgrade)**:
   - High blood pressure (BP >= 140/90 mmHg) flags `RULE-HRP-BP-001` (Gestational Hypertension).
   - Severe anaemia (Hb < 7.0 g/dL) flags `RULE-HRP-HB-002`.
   - Distinct statuses: `REPORTED` -> `RULE_FLAGGED` -> `ASSESSMENT_PENDING` -> `CONFIRMED_HIGH_RISK` -> `RESOLVED`.
   - A subsequent normal reading does **not** auto-downgrade a high-risk case; only an authorized doctor (Medical Officer) can resolve high-risk status.
5. **Emergency Danger Signs & 108 Referral Protocol**:
   - One-tap prominent emergency instructions (left lateral position, 108 Ambulance dispatch, MCP card transport).
   - End-to-end referral tracking from field initiation to receiving hospital admission, discharge, or escalation.
6. **Supervisor & MO Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Live calculations directly from the database (zero hardcoded numbers).
   - Village-by-village performance breakdown, overdue ANC visit tracking, and tamper-evident audit logs.
7. **Approved Maternal Health AI Assistant**:
   - Curated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant indexing MoHFW, NHM, and Tamil Nadu Health guidelines.
   - Explicit citations citing official document title, organization, and version number.
   - Strict safety guardrails: Rejects medical prescription or clinical diagnosis inquiries and refers workers to emergency care.
